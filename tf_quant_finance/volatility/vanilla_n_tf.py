    Parameters
    ----------
    spots : A real `Tensor` of any shape. The current spot prices to
      expiry.
    strikes : A real `Tensor` of the same shape and dtype as `spots`. The
      strikes of the options to be priced.
    volatilities : A real `Tensor` of same shape and dtype as `spots`. The
      volatility to expiry.
    expiries : A real `Tensor` of same shape and dtype as `spots`. The expiry
      for each option. The units should be such that `expiry * volatility**2` is
      dimensionless.
    rates : A real `Tensor` of the same shape and dtype as `spots`. The
      rates of the options to be priced.
    is_call_options: A boolean `Tensor` of a shape compatible with `forwards`.
      Indicates whether to compute the price of a call (if True) or a put (if
      False). If not supplied, it is assumed that every element is a call.
    dtype: Optional `tf.DType`. If supplied, the dtype to be used for conversion
      of any supplied non-`Tensor` arguments to `Tensor`.
      Default value: None which maps to the default dtype inferred by TensorFlow
      (float32).
    name: str. The name for the ops created by this function.
      Default value: None which is mapped to the default name `option_price`.

    Returns
    -------
    option_prices: A `Tensor` of the same shape as `spots`. The Bachelier
    price of the options.

        Args:
        forwards: A real `Tensor` of any shape. The current forward prices to
        expiry.

            Default value: None, interpreted as discount factors = 1.

            Indicates whether to compute the price of a call (if True) or a put (if
