"""Defines Ito processes.

Ito processes underlie most quantitative finance models. This module defines
a framework for describing Ito processes. An Ito process is usually defined
via an Ito SDE:

```
  dX = a(t, X_t) dt + b(t, X_t) dW_t

```

where `a(t, x)` is a function taking values in `R^n`, `b(t, X_t)` is a function
taking values in `n x n` matrices. For a complete mathematical definition,
including the regularity conditions that must be imposed on the coefficients
`a(t, X)` and `b(t, X)`, see Ref [1].

class ItoProcess:
  """Base class for Ito processes.

    Represents a general Ito process:

    ```None
      dX_i = a_i(t, X) dt + Sum(S_{ij}(t, X) dW_j for 1 <= j <= n), 1 <= i <= n
    ```

  The vector coefficient `a_i` is referred to as the drift of the process and
  the matrix `S_{ij}` as the volatility of the process. For the process to be
  well defined, these coefficients need to satisfy certain technical conditions
  which may be found in Ref. [1]. The vector `dW_j` represents independent
  Brownian increments.

  #### Example. 2-dimensional Ito process of the form

  ```none
  dX_1 = mu_1 * sqrt(t) dt + s11 * dW_1 + s12 * dW_2
  dX_2 = mu_2 * sqrt(t) dt + s21 * dW_1 + s22 * dW_2

    """Returns a solver for solving Feynman-Kac PDE associated to the process.

    Constructs a finite differences grid solver for solving the final value
    problem as it appears in the Feynman-Kac formula associated to this Ito
    process. The Feynman-Kac PDE is closely related to the backward Kolomogorov
    equation associated to the stochastic process and allows for the inclusion
    of a discount rate.

    A limited version of Feynman-Kac formula states the following.
    Consider the expectation

    ```None
      V(x, t, T) = E_Q[e^{-R(t, T)} f(X_T) | X_t = x]
    ```

    where `Q` is a probability measure under which `W_j` is an n-dimensional
    Wiener process, `X` is an n-dimensional Ito process satisfying:

    ```None
      dX_i = mu_i dt + Sum[Sigma_{ij} dW_j, 1 <= j <= n]
    ```

    and `R(t, T)` is a positive stochastic process given by:

    ```None
      R(t,T) = Integral[ r(s, X_s) ds, t <= s <= T]
    ```

    This expectation is the solution of the following second order linear
    partial differential equation:

    ```None
      V_t + Sum[mu_i(t, x) V_i, 1<=i<=n] +
        (1/2) Sum[ D_{ij} V_{ij}, 1 <= i,j <= n] - r(t, x) V = 0
    ```

    In the above, `V_t` is the derivative of `V` with respect to `t`,
    `V_i` is the partial derivative with respect to `x_i` and `V_{ij}` the
    (mixed) partial derivative with respect to `x_i` and `x_j`. `D_{ij}` are
    the components of the diffusion tensor:

    ```None
      D_{ij} = (Sigma . Transpose[Sigma])_{ij}
    ```

    This method provides a finite difference solver to solve the above
    differential equation. Whereas the coefficients `mu` and `D` are properties
    of the SDE itself, the function `r(t, x)` may be arbitrarily specified
    by the user (the parameter `discounting_fn` to this method).

    Args:
      final_time: Positive scalar real `Tensor`. The time of the final value.
        The solver is initialized to this final time.
      discounting_fn: Python callable corresponding to the function `r(t, x)` in
        the description above. The callable accepts two positional arguments.
        The first argument is the time at which the discount rate function is
        needed. The second argument contains the values of the state at which
        the discount is to be computed.
        Default value: None which maps to `r(t, x) = 0`.
      grid_spec: An iterable convertible to a tuple containing at least the
        attributes named 'grid', 'dim' and 'sizes'. For a full description of
        the fields and expected types, see `grids.GridSpec` which provides the
        canonical specification of this object.
      time_step: A real positive scalar `Tensor` or None. The fixed
        discretization parameter along the time dimension. Either this argument
        or the `time_step_fn` must be specified. It is an error to specify both.
        Default value: None.
      time_step_fn: A callable accepting an instance of `grids.GridStepperState`
        and returning the size of the next time step as a real scalar tensor.
        This argument allows usage of a non-constant time step while stepping
        back. If not specified, the `time_step` parameter must be specified. It
        is an error to specify both.
        Default value: None.
      values_batch_size: A positive Python int. The batch size of values to be
        propagated simultaneously.
        Default value: 1.
      name: Python str. The name to give this op.
        Default value: None which maps to `fd_solver_backward`.
      **kwargs: Any other keyword args needed.

    Returns:
      An instance of `BackwardGridStepper` configured for solving the
      Feynman-Kac PDE associated to this process.
