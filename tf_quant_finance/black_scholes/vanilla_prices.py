  Args:
    volatilities: Real `Tensor` of any shape and dtype. The volatilities to
      expiry of the options to price.
    strikes: A real `Tensor` of the same dtype and compatible shape as
      `volatilities`. The strikes of the options to be priced.
    expiries: A real `Tensor` of same dtype and compatible shape as
      `volatilities`. The expiry of each option. The units should be such that
      `expiry * volatility**2` is dimensionless.
    spots: A real `Tensor` of any shape that broadcasts to the shape of the
      `volatilities`. The current spot price of the underlying. Either this
      argument or the `forwards` (but not both) must be supplied.
    forwards: A real `Tensor` of any shape that broadcasts to the shape of
      `volatilities`. The forwards to maturity. Either this argument or the
      `spots` must be supplied but both must not be supplied.
    risk_free_rates: An optional real `Tensor` of same dtype as the
      `volatilities`. If not None, discount factors are calculated using it:
      e^(-rT), where r is the risk free rate. If not None, `spots` is supplied
      and `cost_of_carries` is not, also used to compute forwards to expiry.
      Default value: None, equivalent to r = 0 and discount factors = 1 when
      discount_factors also not given.
    cost_of_carries: An optional real `Tensor` of same dtype as the
      `volatilities`. If not None, and `spots` is supplied, used to calculate
      forwards from spots: F = e^(bT) * S. If None, value assumed
      to be equal to the risk free rate.
      Default value: None, equivalent to b = r.
    discount_factors: An optional real `Tensor` of same dtype as the
      `volatilities`. If not None, these are the discount factors to expiry
      (i.e. e^(-rT)). Mutually exclusive with risk_free_rate and cost_of_carry.
      If neither is given, no discounting is applied (i.e. the undiscounted
      option price is returned). If `spots` is supplied and `discount_factors`
      is not None then this is also used to compute the forwards to expiry.
      Default value: None, equivalent to discount factors = 1 when
      risk_free_rates is also not given.
    is_call_options: A boolean `Tensor` of a shape compatible with
      `volatilities`. Indicates whether the option is a call (if True) or a put
      (if False). If not supplied, call options are assumed.
    dtype: Optional `tf.DType`. If supplied, the dtype to be used for conversion
      of any supplied non-`Tensor` arguments to `Tensor`.
      Default value: None which maps to the default dtype inferred by TensorFlow
        (float32).
    name: str. The name for the ops created by this function.
      Default value: None which is mapped to the default name `option_price`.

  Returns:
    option_prices: A `Tensor` of the same shape as `forwards`. The Black
    Scholes price of the options.

  Raises:
    ValueError: If both `forwards` and `spots` are supplied or if neither is
      supplied.
    ValueError: If both `risk_free_rates` and `discount_factors` is supplied.
    ValueError: If `cost_of_carries` is supplied without `discount_factors`.
