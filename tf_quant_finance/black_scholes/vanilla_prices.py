  Args:
    volatilities: Real `Tensor` of any shape and dtype. The volatilities to
      expiry of the options to price.
    strikes: A real `Tensor` of the same dtype and compatible shape as
      `volatilities`. The strikes of the options to be priced.
    expiries: A real `Tensor` of same dtype and compatible shape as
      `volatilities`. The expiry of each option. The units should be such that
      `expiry * volatility**2` is dimensionless.
    spots: A real `Tensor` of any shape that broadcasts to the shape of the
      `volatilities`. The current spot price of the underlying. Either this
      argument or the `forwards` (but not both) must be supplied.
    forwards: A real `Tensor` of any shape that broadcasts to the shape of
      `volatilities`. The forwards to maturity. Either this argument or the
      `spots` must be supplied but both must not be supplied.
    discount_factors: An optional real `Tensor` of same dtype as the
      `volatilities`. If not None, these are the discount factors to expiry
      (i.e. e^(-rT)). If None, no discounting is applied (i.e. the undiscounted
      option price is returned). If `spots` is supplied and `discount_factors`
      is not None then this is also used to compute the forwards to expiry.
      Default value: None, equivalent to discount factors = 1.
    is_call_options: A boolean `Tensor` of a shape compatible with
      `volatilities`. Indicates whether the option is a call (if True) or a put
      (if False). If not supplied, call options are assumed.
    dtype: Optional `tf.DType`. If supplied, the dtype to be used for conversion
      of any supplied non-`Tensor` arguments to `Tensor`.
      Default value: None which maps to the default dtype inferred by TensorFlow
        (float32).
    name: str. The name for the ops created by this function.
      Default value: None which is mapped to the default name `option_price`.

  Returns:
    option_prices: A `Tensor` of the same shape as `forwards`. The Black
    Scholes price of the options.

  Raises:
    ValueError: If both `forwards` and `spots` are supplied or if neither is
      supplied.

  The binary call (resp. put) option priced here is that which pays off a unit
  of cash if the underlying asset has a value greater (resp. smaller) than the
  strike price at expiry. Hence the binary option price is the discounted
  probability that the asset will end up higher (resp. lower) than the
  strike price at expiry.
