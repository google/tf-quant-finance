  """Creates a piecewise constant function."""

  def __init__(self, jump_locations, values, dtype=None, name=None):
    r"""Initializes jumps of the piecewise constant function.

    Sets jump locations and values for a piecewise constant function.
    `jump_locations` split real line into intervals
    `[-inf, jump_locations[..., 0]], ..,
    [jump_locations[..., i], jump_locations[..., i + 1]], ...,
    [jump_locations[..., -1], inf]`
    so that the piecewise constant function takes corresponding `values` on the
    intervals, i.e.,
    ```
    f(x) = \sum_i values[..., i]
           * I_{x \in [jump_locations[..., i -1], jump_locations[..., i])}
    ```

    #### Example. Simple scalar-valued piecewise constant function.
    ```python
    dtype = np.float64
    jump_locations = [0.1, 10]
    values = [3, 4, 5]
    piecewise_func = piecewise.PiecewiseConstantFunc(jump_locations, values,

    integral = piecewise_func.integrate(x, x + 1)
    # Expected integrals: [3.9, 4, 4, 5]
    ```

    #### Example. Matrix-valued piecewise constant function.
    ```python

    # The function takes values [[1, 2], [3, 4]] on (-inf, 0.1),

      jump_locations: A real `Tensor` of shape
        `batch_shape + [num_jump_points]`. The locations where the function

        `event_shape` allows for array-valued piecewise constant functions
